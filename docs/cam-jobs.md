# CAM jobs

A CAM job turns a design's bodies into G-code for one machine. It is a JSON file kept next to
the design (or an object passed inline); nothing of it is saved in the `.sc` file. Three commands
work with jobs, from scripts, the CLI and MCP alike:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `cam.job` | Plans every operation, writes the program through the job's post, reads it back and checks it, and writes the G-code (and an HTML preview) |
| `cam.posts` | Lists the built-in posts, or returns one as JSON to copy into a post file |
| `cam.check` | Reads a G-code file and reports lengths, time, the rotary range, inverse-time blocks and the first line it cannot read |

Units are millimetres and mm/min. Angles in a job are degrees (`a_deg`, `angle_deg`, …).

## `cam.job`

```json
{"job_path": "C:/parts/bracket.cam.json", "output": "C:/parts/bracket.tap", "preview": "C:/parts/bracket.html"}
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `job` | The job as an object. Give this or `job_path`. |
| `job_path` | A `.json` file holding the job. Relative `post_path` and `tool_library_path` in it are read from the file's folder. |
| `output` | The G-code file. Required unless `dry_run`. |
| `preview` | An HTML page of the part and every toolpath: self-contained (no network), one view per operation and one for the whole job, orbit and zoom, a slider that plays the moves, rapids dashed. |
| `dry_run` | Plan and check, write nothing; the reply says whether the checks pass instead of refusing. |
| `allow_unsafe` | Write the program even when a check fails. |

Every file is read and written through the session's file access, so an MCP server's
`--allow-path` folders apply; every path is checked before anything is computed or written.

### The checks

The command never writes a program that fails one of these unless `allow_unsafe` is given:

- **Read-back.** The program as written is read back through the machine's kinematics and
  compared with the toolpaths, both ways round: the tip within the post's precision and
  tolerances (`readback.allowed_tip`), the tool axis within its angle precision.
- **Gouges.** Every cutting move of every operation is sampled and the cutter (shrunk by the
  job's tolerance) must not meet the part or a fixture. An operation that cuts what the model
  does not show (an engraving) sets `gouge_check: false`; the reply lists it under
  `gouge.skipped`.
- **Holder.** For tools with holder data (`stickout` above the flutes, `shank_diameter`,
  `holder`), the shank and holder must not touch the part or a fixture along a cutting move.

Without `dry_run` or `allow_unsafe`, a failure refuses the call with every failed check in the
message. With `dry_run`, the reply carries `passed: false` and `failures`.

### The reply

`operations` (each with `name`, `kind`, `tool`, `moves`, `cut_length`, `cut_minutes`,
`max_tilt_deg`, `a_deg` when indexed, `gouge`, `holder_collisions`, `warnings`), `program_lines`,
`program_head` (the first lines), `readback`, `gouge`, `holder_collisions` (`null` when no tool
has holder data), `passed`, `failures`, `dry_run`, `outputs` (`gcode`, `preview`) and `notes`
(how the bodies were tessellated, a post that writes no work offset, an output extension other
than the post's).

## The job

                   "heights": {"clearance": 30, "retract": 20, "top": 15, "bottom": 12}}},
    {"name": "barrel finish", "type": "rotary_finish", "tool": 2, "pattern": {"type": "lines", "angle_step_deg": 5},
     "clearance": 30, "retract": 22, "range": [-20, 20]}
  ]
}
```

Every object refuses keys it does not know, so a misspelt key is an error, never a setting
silently left at its default. That holds for the tools, the machine and the post too.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The program's name, in its header. Default: the design's name. |
| `machine` | `"3axis"`, `"4axis_a"` (a rotary table about +X, the A axis, through work zero), or a whole machine as the CAM crate's `Machine` JSON (`name`, `rotaries: [{letter, direction, center, carrier, limits?, reversed?}]`, `linear_limits?`, `work_origin?`; radians). |
| `a_reversed` | With `4axis_a`: the controller's positive A turns the table the other way. |
| `a_limits_deg` | With `4axis_a`: `[lowest, highest]` A in degrees. Default: it turns without end. |
| `post` | A built-in post (`cam.posts` lists them): `mach3_4axis`, `linuxcnc_4axis`, `grblhal_4axis`, `rs274_5axis`, `rs274_tcp`. |
| `post_path` | A post as a JSON file: the CAM crate's `Post5` (`cam.posts {"name": …}` returns one to start from). This is how a machine maker's own post is matched: copy the closest built-in post and change its header, tool change, spindle, comments, decimals, inverse time and rotary settings until its output matches. |
| `work_offset` | 1 to 6 (G54 to G59), for posts whose header writes `{work_offset}`. Default: 1. |
| `origin` | The design point that is work zero, `[x, y, z]`. Default: the design's origin. |
| `bodies` | The part's bodies by name. Default: every visible body not in `fixtures`. |
| `fixtures` | Bodies the tool must stay clear of (vises, clamps): in the gouge and holder checks only, never machined. |
| `tolerance` | 0.0001 to 1 mm (default 0.01): how far a toolpath may be from the part, and how deep a cut into it counts as a gouge. |
| `tools` | The tools, as the CAM crate's `Tool` JSON (below). Give this or `tool_library_path`. |
| `tool_library_path` | A JSON file holding an array of tools. |
| `operations` | 1 to 200 operations, run and written in order (below). |

### Coordinates

Work coordinates are the design's coordinates less `origin`. On a 4th axis the rotary axis is
work X through work zero: model the part with its turning axis along the design's X through the
origin, or give `origin` as a point on that axis. A rotary toolpath's tip at angle θ and radius
ρ is at `(x, ρ sin θ, ρ cos θ)` with `A = θ`: A = +90° brings the work's +Y side up under the
tool.

### Tessellation

Each body is tessellated from its exact B-rep surfaces with a chord tolerance of half the job's
tolerance (`solidcraft_kernel::MeshTolerance::chord`, the tolerance-driven path the mesh exports
are built on; the export presets `standard`/`fine`/`finest` are a share of the body's size and
so are not used). The facets then lie within half the tolerance of the true surfaces, which
leaves the other half for the toolpath. A mesh body (an imported STL, 3MF or OBJ) is used as it
is; the reply's notes say so.

### Tools

`number`, `kind` (`flat_endmill`, `ball_endmill`, `bull_nose`, `drill`), `diameter`,
`flute_length`, and optional `description`, `flutes`, `spindle_rpm`, `feed`, `plunge_feed`,
`stepdown`, `stepover`, `corner_radius` (bull nose), `shank_diameter`, `stickout`, `holder:
[{diameter, length}]`. An operation without `spindle_rpm` or `feeds` takes the tool's; its
stepdown and stepover default to the tool's too.

### Operations

Every operation has `name`, `type`, `tool` (a tool's `number`), and optionally `spindle_rpm`,
`feeds: {cut, plunge}`, `coolant` (default false) and `gouge_check` (default true). `heights`
are `{clearance, retract, top, bottom}` in the operation's coordinates.

| `type` | Keys (defaults) |
| --- | --- |
| `contour` | `sketch` (id or name) + `profiles?` (indices; default every drawn profile) or `polygon: [[x, y], …]`; `heights`; `stepdown` (tool's, else half its diameter); `side`: `outside` \| `inside` \| `on` (outside); `climb` (true); `stock_to_leave` (0); `ramp_angle_deg` (0: plunge); `tolerance` (the job's) |
| `pocket` | `sketch` + `profiles?` or `polygon`; `heights`; `stepdown`; `stepover` (tool's, else 40% of its diameter); `climb`; `stock_to_leave`; `ramp_angle_deg`; `tolerance` |
| `parallel` | `heights` (`bottom` is the floor); `stepover` (tool's, else 10% of its diameter); `angle_deg` (0); `boundary?: {rect?: [[x, y], [x, y]], polygon?}` (the part's extent); `stock_to_leave` (0); `step` (a quarter of the diameter); `tolerance`; `zigzag` (true) |
| `roughing` | `heights` (`top` is the stock's top); `stepdown`; `stepover`; `angle_deg`; `boundary`; `stock_to_leave` (0.25); `step`; `tolerance`; `zigzag` |
| `waterline` | `heights` (levels from `top` to `bottom`); `stepdown` (tool's, else a quarter of its diameter); `boundary`; `stock_to_leave` (0); `step`; `tolerance`; `climb` (true) |
| `adaptive` | `sketch` + `profiles?` or `polygon`; `heights`; `stepdown` (tool's, else its diameter); `optimal_load` (tool's `stepover`, else 10% of its diameter); `min_engagement_deg`, `max_engagement_deg` (from the load: see [Adaptive clearing](#adaptive-clearing)); `helix_diameter` (80% of the tool's); `ramp_angle_deg` (2); `climb`; `stock_to_leave` (0); `tolerance`; `compare` (true) |
| `adaptive_roughing` | `heights` (`top` is the stock's top); `stepdown`; `optimal_load`; `min_engagement_deg`, `max_engagement_deg`; `helix_diameter`; `ramp_angle_deg`; `climb`; `boundary` (the stock's extent; the part's extent); `stock_to_leave` (0.25); `flats` (true); `tolerance` |
| `indexed` | `a_deg` and `operation`: any of the five above, run with A held at `a_deg` (3+1). Only these two keys; the inner operation carries the name, tool and feeds. |
| `rotary_finish` | `pattern`: `{type: "lines", angle_step_deg, zigzag?}` or `{type: "helix", pitch}`; `clearance` and `retract` (radii from the A axis); `floor` (0); `range: [min x, max x]` (the part's extent); `step`; `tolerance`; `stock_to_leave` (0); `max_angle_step_deg` (2) |
| `rotary_roughing` | As `rotary_finish`, with `stock_radius`, `stepdown` (in radius) and `stock_to_leave` (0.25) |
| `wrap` | `radius` (of the cylinder the path is drawn on); `points: [[x, y, z], …]` (x along the axis, y the arc length round it, z the depth: 0 on the cylinder, negative into it) or `sketch` + `curve` (a curve id; its sketch x and y are taken as x and arc length) with `depth` (0); `clearance` (5) and `retract` (1) above the cylinder; `max_angle_step_deg` (2) |

The 3-axis operations (`contour` to `waterline`) run with every rotary at zero; on `3axis` and
`4axis_a` that is work coordinates. Inside `indexed` their heights, polygons and boundaries are
in the frame A = `a_deg` brings under the tool: its Z is the tool axis, so at A = 90° the frame's
Z is work +Y. A sketch used as a boundary must lie on a plane square to the operation's tool axis
and facing it (for a plain 3-axis operation, a plane facing +Z), in the design's root component.
Indexed and 3-axis operations are written with arcs kept (`G2`/`G3`); rotary and wrapped
operations as short cuts, each turning A by at most `max_angle_step_deg`, in inverse time where
the post says so.

## `cam.posts`

`{}` lists the built-in posts with a one-line description and their other names; `{"name":
"mach3_4axis"}` returns that post's JSON. Save it as a file, change it, and point a job's
`post_path` at it. Keep a machine-specific post outside the repository.

## `cam.check`

`{"path": "part.tap", "rapid_rate": 3000}` reads the file and returns `lines`, `motion_blocks`,
`rapid_length`, `feed_length`, `cut_minutes` (as the controller times it: inverse-time blocks by
their `F`), `rapid_minutes` (with `rapid_rate`), `arcs`, `g93_blocks`, `rotary_ranges` (each
rotary letter's lowest and highest angle), `bounds` and `errors` (the first line the reader
cannot read). It reads the absolute-coordinate G-code SolidCraft's posts write; programs from
elsewhere are read on a best-effort basis and stop at the first block it cannot follow
(incremental coordinates, for one).

## Adaptive clearing

`adaptive` (2D, like `pocket`) and `adaptive_roughing` (3D, like `roughing`) clear material with
the tool's engagement held down: the share of its circumference in material never goes above
`max_engagement_deg` outside an entry helix, so the tool never runs in a full slot. This suits a
small, not very rigid mill best: take a deep `stepdown` (the flute length the tool's data allows)
with a light `optimal_load` (5% to 15% of the diameter) and the full feed.

The path is planned on a raster of the material a sixteenth of the tool radius fine, with exact
distances to the path already planned near the edge of the cut. It is walked in short steps,
turning at most 25° a step, so its corners are rounded; at each step it takes the heading whose
engagement is nearest the optimal load's (on a straight edge `acos(1 − load / radius)`), with the
material on the climb (or conventional) side, and never one above the limit. Where a walk can
cut no more, the next starts where cleared space meets material, reached by a feed through
cleared material when there is one with the tool down, by lifting to `retract` otherwise.

- **Entry.** Where the tool can reach the material from open air (round the stock in
  `adaptive_roughing`) it goes down outside it. Material enclosed on every side is entered with
  a helix of `helix_diameter` at `ramp_angle_deg`, then a circle at the level; with no room for
  the helix the operation is refused, saying so.
- **Levels.** `adaptive` cuts the same path at every depth pass. `adaptive_roughing` plans each
  level where the dropped cutter (grown by `stock_to_leave`) is at or below it; with `flats` it
  adds a level at every flat area of the part (raised by the stock to leave). Levels further
  apart than the tool's `flute_length` are refused: the shank would rub on the wall the flutes
  leave.
- **Corners.** An inside corner sharper than the limit allows is not driven into: a fillet
  somewhat larger than the tool's is left there for a finishing contour (`left_area` in the
  report).

Defaults: `optimal_load` is the tool's `stepover` (a tool library's adaptive start values), else
10% of its diameter; `max_engagement_deg` one and a half times the optimal load's engagement and
at least 15° more than it; `min_engagement_deg` a third of it, and at most half the
`max_engagement_deg`. A `max_engagement_deg` below the load's engagement wins: the path aims at
the narrower width the limit allows, which is slower to plan; a width under about 3% of the
tool's radius can be refused as too much work.

- **Stock.** `adaptive_roughing` takes the material as the box over `boundary` (its rectangle,
  and inside its polygon too) from `top` down, and goes down to a level in the open air outside
  it. Without `boundary.rect` the stock is the part's extent seen from above, and the report
  warns: a blank larger than that would be cut into from the side at the level's full depth, so
  give the blank's extent as `boundary.rect`. Nothing round the stock is modelled: keep the
  levels that go down outside it above the vise jaws and clamps.

Each adaptive operation's report carries `adaptive`, measured along the path as written,
independently of the planner (exact containment in the profiles or stock, exact distances to
every earlier move, the tool's circumference looked at in 1° steps): `measured` (false when the
path was too long to measure: the figures are then 0, and a warning says so), `max_engagement_deg`,
`max_entry_engagement_deg`, `mean_engagement_deg`, `full_slot_share` (of the cutting time
outside entries at 170° or more: 0), `entry_slot_share`, `limit_deg`, `levels`, `helices`,
`lifts`, `left_area` and, for `adaptive` with `compare`, `pocket`: a plain offset pocket of the
same profiles (stepover 40% of the diameter) measured the same way (`max_engagement_deg`,
`full_slot_share`, `cut_length`, `cut_minutes`). A measured engagement more than 3° above
`limit_deg`, or any full slot outside the entries, is also a warning of the operation. Both
operations also work inside `indexed`.
