# CAM jobs

A CAM job turns a design's bodies into G-code for one machine. It is a JSON file kept next to
the design (or an object passed inline); nothing of it is saved in the `.sc` file. Three commands
work with jobs, from scripts, the CLI and MCP alike:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `cam.job` | Plans every operation, writes the program through the job's post, reads it back and checks it, and writes the G-code (and an HTML preview) |
| `cam.posts` | Lists the built-in posts, or returns one as JSON to copy into a post file |
| `cam.check` | Reads a G-code file and reports lengths, time, the rotary range, inverse-time blocks and the first line it cannot read |

Units are millimetres and mm/min. Angles in a job are degrees (`a_deg`, `angle_deg`, …).

## `cam.job`

```json
{"job_path": "C:/parts/bracket.cam.json", "output": "C:/parts/bracket.tap", "preview": "C:/parts/bracket.html"}
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `job` | The job as an object. Give this or `job_path`. |
| `job_path` | A `.json` file holding the job. Relative `post_path` and `tool_library_path` in it are read from the file's folder. |
| `output` | The G-code file. Required unless `dry_run`. |
| `preview` | An HTML page of the part and every toolpath: self-contained (no network), one view per operation and one for the whole job, orbit and zoom, a slider that plays the moves, rapids dashed. |
| `dry_run` | Plan and check, write nothing; the reply says whether the checks pass instead of refusing. |
| `allow_unsafe` | Write the program even when a check fails. |

Every file is read and written through the session's file access, so an MCP server's
`--allow-path` folders apply; every path is checked before anything is computed or written.

### The checks

The command never writes a program that fails one of these unless `allow_unsafe` is given:

- **Read-back.** The program as written is read back through the machine's kinematics and
  compared with the toolpaths, both ways round: the tip within the post's precision and
  tolerances (`readback.allowed_tip`), the tool axis within its angle precision.
- **Gouges.** Every cutting move of every operation is sampled and the cutter (shrunk by the
  job's tolerance) must not meet the part or a fixture. An operation that cuts what the model
  does not show (an engraving) sets `gouge_check: false`; the reply lists it under
  `gouge.skipped`.
- **Holder.** For tools with holder data (`stickout` above the flutes, `shank_diameter`,
  `holder`), the shank and holder must not touch the part or a fixture along a cutting move.

Without `dry_run` or `allow_unsafe`, a failure refuses the call with every failed check in the
message. With `dry_run`, the reply carries `passed: false` and `failures`.

### The reply

`operations` (each with `name`, `kind`, `tool`, `moves`, `cut_length`, `cut_minutes`,
`max_tilt_deg`, `a_deg` when indexed, `gouge`, `holder_collisions`, `warnings`), `program_lines`,
`program_head` (the first lines), `readback`, `gouge`, `holder_collisions` (`null` when no tool
has holder data), `passed`, `failures`, `dry_run`, `outputs` (`gcode`, `preview`) and `notes`
(how the bodies were tessellated, a post that writes no work offset, an output extension other
than the post's).

## The job

     "clearance": 30, "retract": 22, "range": [-20, 20]}
  ]
}
```

Every object refuses keys it does not know, so a misspelt key is an error, never a setting
silently left at its default. That holds for the tools, the machine and the post too.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The program's name, in its header. Default: the design's name. |
| `machine` | `"3axis"`, `"4axis_a"` (a rotary table about +X, the A axis, through work zero), or a whole machine as the CAM crate's `Machine` JSON (`name`, `rotaries: [{letter, direction, center, carrier, limits?, reversed?}]`, `linear_limits?`, `work_origin?`; radians). |
| `a_reversed` | With `4axis_a`: the controller's positive A turns the table the other way. |
| `a_limits_deg` | With `4axis_a`: `[lowest, highest]` A in degrees. Default: it turns without end. |
| `post` | A built-in post (`cam.posts` lists them): `mach3_4axis`, `linuxcnc_4axis`, `grblhal_4axis`, `rs274_5axis`, `rs274_tcp`. |
| `post_path` | A post as a JSON file: the CAM crate's `Post5` (`cam.posts {"name": …}` returns one to start from). This is how a machine maker's own post is matched: copy the closest built-in post and change its header, tool change, spindle, comments, decimals, inverse time and rotary settings until its output matches. |
| `work_offset` | 1 to 6 (G54 to G59), for posts whose header writes `{work_offset}`. Default: 1. |
| `origin` | The design point that is work zero, `[x, y, z]`. Default: the design's origin. |
| `bodies` | The part's bodies by name. Default: every visible body not in `fixtures`. |
| `fixtures` | Bodies the tool must stay clear of (vises, clamps): in the gouge and holder checks only, never machined. |
| `tolerance` | 0.0001 to 1 mm (default 0.01): how far a toolpath may be from the part, and how deep a cut into it counts as a gouge. |
| `tools` | The tools, as the CAM crate's `Tool` JSON (below). Give this or `tool_library_path`. |
| `tool_library_path` | A JSON file holding an array of tools. |
| `operations` | 1 to 200 operations, run and written in order (below). |

### Coordinates

Work coordinates are the design's coordinates less `origin`. On a 4th axis the rotary axis is
work X through work zero: model the part with its turning axis along the design's X through the
origin, or give `origin` as a point on that axis. A rotary toolpath's tip at angle θ and radius
ρ is at `(x, ρ sin θ, ρ cos θ)` with `A = θ`: A = +90° brings the work's +Y side up under the
tool.

### Tessellation

Each body is tessellated from its exact B-rep surfaces with a chord tolerance of half the job's
tolerance (`solidcraft_kernel::MeshTolerance::chord`, the tolerance-driven path the mesh exports
are built on; the export presets `standard`/`fine`/`finest` are a share of the body's size and
so are not used). The facets then lie within half the tolerance of the true surfaces, which
leaves the other half for the toolpath. A mesh body (an imported STL, 3MF or OBJ) is used as it
is; the reply's notes say so.

### Tools

`number`, `kind` (`flat_endmill`, `ball_endmill`, `bull_nose`, `drill`), `diameter`,
`flute_length`, and optional `description`, `flutes`, `spindle_rpm`, `feed`, `plunge_feed`,
`stepdown`, `stepover`, `corner_radius` (bull nose), `shank_diameter`, `stickout`, `holder:
[{diameter, length}]`, `point_angle_deg` (a drill's point, default 118). An operation without `spindle_rpm` or `feeds` takes the tool's; its
stepdown and stepover default to the tool's too.

### Operations

Every operation has `name`, `type`, `tool` (a tool's `number`), and optionally `spindle_rpm`,
`feeds: {cut, plunge}`, `coolant` (default false) and `gouge_check` (default true). `heights`
are `{clearance, retract, top, bottom}` in the operation's coordinates.

| `type` | Keys (defaults) |
| --- | --- |
| `contour` | `sketch` (id or name) + `profiles?` (indices; default every drawn profile) or `polygon: [[x, y], …]`; `heights`; `stepdown` (tool's, else half its diameter); `side`: `outside` \| `inside` \| `on` (outside); `climb` (true); `stock_to_leave` (0); `ramp_angle_deg` (0: plunge); `tolerance` (the job's) |
| `pocket` | `sketch` + `profiles?` or `polygon`; `heights`; `stepdown`; `stepover` (tool's, else 40% of its diameter); `climb`; `stock_to_leave`; `ramp_angle_deg`; `tolerance` |
| `parallel` | `heights` (`bottom` is the floor); `stepover` (tool's, else 10% of its diameter); `angle_deg` (0); `boundary?: {rect?: [[x, y], [x, y]], polygon?}` (the part's extent); `stock_to_leave` (0); `step` (a quarter of the diameter); `tolerance`; `zigzag` (true) |
| `roughing` | `heights` (`top` is the stock's top); `stepdown`; `stepover`; `angle_deg`; `boundary`; `stock_to_leave` (0.25); `step`; `tolerance`; `zigzag` |
| `waterline` | `heights` (levels from `top` to `bottom`); `stepdown` (tool's, else a quarter of its diameter); `boundary`; `stock_to_leave` (0); `step`; `tolerance`; `climb` (true) |
| `drill` | `sketch` (circle centres, `circles` (true), filtered by `diameter_range: [min, max]`, and lone points, `sketch_points` (true)) or `points: [[x, y], …]`; `heights` (`retract` is the R height, `top` the hole's top, `bottom` its depth); `cycle`: `simple` \| `dwell` \| `peck` \| `chip_break` (simple); `peck` (tool's stepdown, else its diameter); `peck_clearance` (0.5); `back_off` (0.5); `dwell_seconds` (0.5); `to_full_diameter` (false); `stay_at_retract` (false). See [Drilling](#drilling). |
| `indexed` | `a_deg` and `operation`: any of the six above, run with A held at `a_deg` (3+1). Only these two keys; the inner operation carries the name, tool and feeds. |
| `rotary_finish` | `pattern`: `{type: "lines", angle_step_deg, zigzag?}` or `{type: "helix", pitch}`; `clearance` and `retract` (radii from the A axis); `floor` (0); `range: [min x, max x]` (the part's extent); `step`; `tolerance`; `stock_to_leave` (0); `max_angle_step_deg` (2) |
| `rotary_roughing` | As `rotary_finish`, with `stock_radius`, `stepdown` (in radius) and `stock_to_leave` (0.25) |
| `wrap` | `radius` (of the cylinder the path is drawn on); `points: [[x, y, z], …]` (x along the axis, y the arc length round it, z the depth: 0 on the cylinder, negative into it) or `sketch` + `curve` (a curve id; its sketch x and y are taken as x and arc length) with `depth` (0); `clearance` (5) and `retract` (1) above the cylinder; `max_angle_step_deg` (2) |

The 3-axis operations (`contour` to `drill`) run with every rotary at zero; on `3axis` and
`4axis_a` that is work coordinates. Inside `indexed` their heights, polygons and boundaries are
in the frame A = `a_deg` brings under the tool: its Z is the tool axis, so at A = 90° the frame's
Z is work +Y. A sketch used as a boundary must lie on a plane square to the operation's tool axis
and facing it (for a plain 3-axis operation, a plane facing +Z), in the design's root component.
Indexed and 3-axis operations are written with arcs kept (`G2`/`G3`); rotary and wrapped
operations as short cuts, each turning A by at most `max_angle_step_deg`, in inverse time where
the post says so.

## `cam.posts`

`{}` lists the built-in posts with a one-line description and their other names; `{"name":
"mach3_4axis"}` returns that post's JSON. Save it as a file, change it, and point a job's
`post_path` at it. Keep a machine-specific post outside the repository.

## `cam.check`

`{"path": "part.tap", "rapid_rate": 3000}` reads the file and returns `lines`, `motion_blocks`,
`rapid_length`, `feed_length`, `cut_minutes` (as the controller times it: inverse-time blocks by
their `F`), `rapid_minutes` (with `rapid_rate`), `arcs`, `g93_blocks`, `rotary_ranges` (each
rotary letter's lowest and highest angle), `bounds` and `errors` (the first line the reader
cannot read). It reads the absolute-coordinate G-code SolidCraft's posts write; programs from
elsewhere are read on a best-effort basis and stop at the first block it cannot follow
(incremental coordinates, for one).

## Drilling

A `drill` operation feeds a drill (or a flat end mill, plunging) straight down the tool axis at
each hole, at the operation's plunge feed. Any other tool is refused. It is a 3-axis operation,
so it also runs inside `indexed`: its points and heights are then in the frame the angle brings
under the tool.

```json
{"name": "holes", "type": "drill", "tool": 3, "sketch": "Holes", "diameter_range": [4, 5],
 "heights": {"clearance": 15, "retract": 2, "top": 0, "bottom": -12}, "cycle": "peck", "peck": 4}
```

**Holes.** With `sketch`: the centres of its circles (not construction ones; with
`diameter_range`, only circles of a diameter in it) and its points that are not part of a curve.
The sketch must lie on a plane square to the tool axis (either way up). With `points`: the
holes in the operation's XY. Repeated positions are drilled once. Holes are drilled in a greedy
nearest-neighbour order from the one lowest in X (then Y), the same order every time.

**Cycles.** Every cycle is written as plain `G0`/`G1` moves and a `G4` dwell, which every
controller reads and the read-back follows; no canned cycle (`G81`, `G82`, `G83`, `G73`) is
written.

| `cycle` | Each hole |
| --- | --- |
| `simple` | Feed from the R height to the bottom, rapid out to R. |
| `dwell` | The same, with a pause of `dwell_seconds` at the bottom. |
| `peck` | Feed `peck` deeper at a time, counted from `top` (the last peck ends at the bottom); after each peck rapid right out to R, then rapid back down to `peck_clearance` above the depth reached. |
| `chip_break` | Feed `peck` deeper at a time; after each peck rapid back `back_off` (staying in the hole) to break the chip, then feed on. |

**Depth.** `bottom` is where the tip goes. With `to_full_diameter: true` it is where the drill
reaches its full diameter, and the tip goes deeper by the point's length, radius / tan(point
angle / 2): 1.80 mm for a 6 mm drill with a 118° point. A hole deeper than the tool's flutes is
refused.

**Between holes** the tool rises to the clearance height. `stay_at_retract: true` travels at the R
height instead, and is refused unless the R height is above the highest point of the part and the
fixtures in the operation's frame.

**Checks.** The gouge check holds a drill against the part as its real shape: the full diameter
from the point's length up, and the point as stepped cylinders inscribed in its cone (within the
job's tolerance along the axis, at most 64 steps). Model the holes as cut bodies; drilled into a
part that shows no hole, the operation gouges and the job is refused.
